##Tweeter-Totters
===============

####About
This is WPF project intended to be a desktop application providing basic to advanced Twitter functionality. This project is more or a less a project to get a basic grasp on how something I use frequently, works.
It is written in C# and will be using the TweetSharp library that has been reccommended by Twitter. The library can be found here: https://github.com/danielcrenna/tweetsharp
