##Tweeter-Totters

####About (Currently in the very early stages of development)
This is WPF project intended to be a desktop application providing basic to advanced Twitter functionality. This project is more or a less a learning experience to get a basic grasp on the underlying Twitter API, and try out WPF. Since this is my first attempt at WPF, I don't intend on completely separating the code into a MVVM design pattern.
It is written in C# and will be using the TweetSharp library that has been reccommended by Twitter. The library can be found here: https://github.com/danielcrenna/tweetsharp <br />
