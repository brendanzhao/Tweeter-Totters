##Tweeter-Totters

####About (Currently in the very early stages of development)
This is WPF project intended to be a desktop application providing basic to advanced Twitter functionality. <br />
This project is more or a less a learning experience to get a basic grasp on the underlying Twitter API, and to learn how to use WPF along with it's many features.<br />
Currently the project is written with one main WPF window holding all logical fields and GUI elements and calls on a static utility class to perform any logic or request. Far into the future, a full separation of interaction layers is the goal by using the Model View ViewModel design.<br />

It is written in C# and will be using the TweetSharp library that has been reccommended by Twitter. The library can be found here: https://github.com/danielcrenna/tweetsharp
